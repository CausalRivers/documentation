This is quite a dirty crawl.


Idea: 

1. Crawl all River names from different sources (+ sinks such as lakes, non river, coast etc.)
2. Attempt to get the wiki link too the river that is fed by the current river (done for each river of 1)
3. Crawl some ids that might be useful for each river in 1.
4. Crawl the coordinates of the river ends and the sink nodes. This might fail etc. but should be useful for displaying.
5. Finally get elevation of each river crossing and the sink nodes for later usage.
6. we unify all of these informations into a graph for later usage.
